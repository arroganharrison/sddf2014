We aim to create a web-app to aid in the sharing of RPI meal swipes.
It will have a similar UI to the mobile dating app Tinder.
People with available swipes will open the app and click a button that indicates they are willing to share food, and then the UI will allow them to select a meal partner(s).
People without available swipes will open the app and click a button that indicates they are requesting food, and then the app will notify them when someone has offered to give them food.
We plan to code it in Javascript, JQuery, HTML, CSS with an undecided back-end implementation.
Potential features:
	- Log-in capability?
	- Chat capability?
	- Picture capability?
